# Gitlet
A Version Control System, inspired by Git. Designed in Java.

This version control system mimics some of the basic features of the popular version control system git, only smaller ofcourse. For the uninitiated, a version control system helps you save snapshots of your files at different points in time. That way, if you mess them up later, you can return to earlier versions.

Gitlet supports operations such as staging/unstaging files, merging, removing, rebasing and interactively rebasing branches. It also utilizes SCP to provide for remote operations such as pull, push and clone.
