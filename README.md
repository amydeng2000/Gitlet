# Gitlet
A Version Control System, inspired by Git, implemented in Java.

This Version Control System mimics some of the basic features of the popular version control system Git. Gitlet supports operations such as staging/unstaging files, merging, removing, rebasing and interactively rebasing branches. It also utilizes SCP to provide for remote operations such as pulling, pushing and cloning branches remotely.
